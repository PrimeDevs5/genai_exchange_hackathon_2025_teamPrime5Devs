   # Backend API (if applicable)
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication with Email/Password and Google providers
   - Copy your Firebase configuration to the `.env` file
